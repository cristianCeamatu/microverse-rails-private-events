# Private events web app built in rails

> In this project, we built by collaborating remotely a private events app following the project requirements from [TheOdinProject website](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations). The project enforced our skills in using Model associations and create from scratch Models, Controllers, Views, and Migrations.

## This web app is live, you can check it here: [Live demo](http://t.me/master_search_ruby_bot)
