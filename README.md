# Private events web app built in rails

> In this project, we built by collaborating remotely a private events app following the project requirements from [TheOdinProject website](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations). The project enforced our skills in using Model associations and create from scratch Models, Controllers, Views, and Migrations.

## App functionality
* Users can be created, they can sign in and sign out
* Users can create and attend events
* Events are categorized in past and upcoming events based on their date

## This web app is live, you can check it here: [Live demo](https://obscure-sierra-39976.herokuapp.com/)
